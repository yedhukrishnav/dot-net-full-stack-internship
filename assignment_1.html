    <p>Front-end development primarily focuses on user experience. Using the related coding and design techniques, you as front-end developers build the elements of an application that are directly accessed by end-users with a goal of rendering the entire interface elegant, easy to use, fast, and secure, fostering user engagement and interaction.

        As part of creating an engaging user interface, front end app development often focus on specific design elements such as text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, and overall color schemes. These elements play a crucial role in enhancing the visual appeal and user-friendliness of the application. 
        
        Front end app development encompasses various interactive elements like sliders, pop-up forms, and custom interactive maps. An essential part of a front end application are navigational menus, which guide users through the application, enhancing their overall experience and interaction with the website or application. The creation of intuitive and user-friendly navigational menus is a key skill for front-end developers.</p>

    <p>Back-end development refers to the part of a website or application that you donâ€™t see, which works behind the scenes to make everything function properly. It handles the communication between the database (where information is stored) and the browser (where you see and interact with the website).

        In other words, it focuses on ensuring that the front-end elements of a web application can function seamlessly. The main focus areas of back-end development are:
        
        Server: The hardware or software that provides services to other computers in the network. For instance, web servers host websites and serve them to users who request them via browsers.
        Database: The organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically. Databases store everything from user information to transaction records, which the application needs to access and manipulate.
        Application logic: The code that defines the behavior and logic of an application. This includes everything from processing user inputs to performing calculations and making decisions based on the data.
        For example, when you log into a website, the back-end code checks the database for your credentials (username and password) and, if correct, retrieves and returns the correct user data to the front end. It then displays your personalized content.</p>
